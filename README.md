# ukbFound

This is the official codebase for **A foundational model encodes deep phenotyping data and enables diverse downstream application**. 

ukbFound: a foundation model with 25.3 million parameters that encoded thousands of individual-level traits into language-like sequences. By incorporating domain-specific tokenization, position-free embedding, and interpretable reasoning, ukbFound effectively captures latent disease-trait relationships from deep phenotyping data of 502,342 UK Biobank individuals.
